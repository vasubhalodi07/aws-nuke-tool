        Welcome to AWS Nuke, your ultimate tool for securely deleting AWS
        resources. AWS Nuke is designed to help you efficiently clean up unused
        or unwanted resources from your AWS account. With AWS Nuke, you can
        confidently remove AWS resources across multiple regions, accounts, and
        services, streamlining your infrastructure management process.

        At AWS Nuke, we prioritize the security and privacy of your AWS
        credentials. It's essential to note that AWS Nuke does not store any AWS
        credentials on our servers. Your AWS credentials are stored locally on
        your PC only for the duration of the script execution. Once the script
        completes, your AWS credentials are deleted from your PC, ensuring that
        your sensitive information remains secure at all times.
